## Hello! I am Pang Jing Hui 彭竞辉.

Welcome to the digital canvas where my dual passions for technology and creativity merge. As a seasoned Full-Stack Software Engineer, Technical Leader, and Project Manager based in the tech-savvy landscape of Singapore, I orchestrate symphonies of code that empower businesses and enrich lives. Currently, I'm rocking the digital world at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/), where every day feels like a hit track!



## My Story

Born from a curiosity that leaped beyond the conventional, my academic journey began with 5As in SMKTPI, Malaysia. This led me to the shores of [Singapore Polytechnic](https://www.sp.edu.sg/), where I not only honed my technical acumen in **Data Structures and Algorithms** but also refined my aesthetic senses in **UI/UX Design**. It's here where I learnt that the elegance of a user experience is crafted in the subtleties of code.



## My Professional Palette

With expertise in languages like Elixir, Java, PHP, and JavaScript, alongside modern frameworks and databases, I've shaped digital landscapes across diverse industries. At Pixium Digital, I not only led teams but also architected robust infrastructures and innovative solutions.

From optimising MySQL and PostgreSQL queries for lightning-fast analytics dashboards to pioneering a game-changing Zoom integration feature, my journey has been about pushing the boundaries of what's technically feasible. Crafting advanced file management systems and designing responsive web applications, I don't just speak the language of efficiency and user-centricity—I live it. My career stands as a testament to the belief that engineering is not merely a profession but a calling to overcome the "impossible." Every line of code is a part of a revolution in how we interact with the world. This relentless pursuit of innovation keeps my passion for my job burning fiercely every day.



## My Ethos

In every facet of life, I embed a simple yet profound ethos: **"If you truly try your best, you can't lose."** This philosophy, inspired by various thinkers, resonates deeply with me. It reminds me that persistence and passion are unbeatable, steering my approach towards challenges both in life and technology. While every voice brings a unique perspective, I strive to absorb what aligns with my values, distilling insights that fortify my resolve. Some opinions might be contentious, but there is often a kernel of truth that, when thoughtfully considered, can contribute significantly to personal and professional growth.

In my professional sphere, I am guided by three core principles: **to enhance, to simplify, and to surpass expectations**. These are not just goals, but commitments to build not merely for the present but for a future where my contributions continue to evolve and inspire. Each project is an opportunity to push boundaries and redefine the standards of what technology can achieve.



## Beyond the Brackets

But life isn't all about algorithms and architectures. When the monitors dim, I step into the rhythm of life as a professional beatbox artist. Here are a few highlights from my beatboxing career:

- **Champion of Clementi Community Centre 2018, Singapore.**
- **Champion of Radiance Beatbox Jam 2019, Singapore.**
- **Champion of A Cappella Beatbox Championship 2019, Singapore.**
- **Champion of Cypher Beatbox Battle 2019, Singapore.**
- **Top 16 at Armageddon International Beatbox Battle 2019, Malaysia.**
- **Top 8 at The Capital Beatbox Battle 2019, Malaysia.**
- **Vice Champion of A Cappella Beatbox Championship 2021, Singapore.**

In the cadence of beats, I find another dimension of creativity and expression. This harmony between my professional expertise and artistic passion is what makes me, me.

## The Journey Continues

Every day, I write the future in code, driven by the same "**Day 1**" spirit that has been my guiding star. Whether you are here to explore a partnership, dive into my portfolio, or simply share in my journey, I'm glad you're here. :)

Let's connect the dots between technology and artistry. Let's build something remarkable together.

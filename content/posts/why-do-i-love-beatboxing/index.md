## Why do i love beatboxing?

lately, i've been feeling so demotivated, stuck in a loop of the same old beats without anything fresh or creative coming out, i've been trying-forcing myself, even-but nothing feels right, it's honestly frustrating. 😭

i trust the process and i know i won't give up, but right now i'm just mad at myself hitting this wall.

out of nowhere, i decided to reach out to [Artsy](https://www.instagram.com/artsybeatbox)—a beatboxer i've looked up to for a long time. he's one of the beatboxers who inspired me a lot as i started my beatboxing journey, and until now his beats still blow my mind. so i messaged him and asked, *"hey bro, i'm prepping for Voices-the upcoming beatbox competition-but i'm really struggling to come up with anything new. i keep falling back on my old stuff. how do you stay at the top and keep creating new, next-level shit?"*

after a long talk with him, he left me with something that hit me hard: *"Have some patience and try to approach beatboxing in a humble manner, and really go back to your root—like why did you love beatboxing?"*

that question got me thinking deeply about my roots in beatboxing, and that's why i am here, writing this reflection on: **why do i love beatboxing?**

> the competition is just 31 days away as i write this ... (assuming that i win the wildcard)

why?

what does it actually give me?

does beatboxing still make me happy?

how do i feel when i beatbox?

...

i loved beatboxing.

i loved the thrill of seeing people move to my beats.

i loved the freedom in creating music on my own terms.

i loved the inspiration and creativity it sparked in me-it used to bring so much joy.

so why am i losing this feeling now?

how do i find my way back?

i think i've figured out why i love beatboxing...

it's the reaction.

i love seeing how people light up when they hear my beats, the way they react-whether it's suprise, excitement, or awe.


i love it when i hear people saying good things about my beatboxing, and yeah, maybe it's a bit of attention seeking. but i've realised that this drive, this need to connect with others through my art is what made me who i am today.

when i first started beatboxing, i didn't just keep it to myself. i immediately signed up for my school's talent show. the stage, the crowd, the energy-it was unforgettable. i ended up winning the competition two years in a row, and the attention i got was unreal.

suddenly, i had all these new friends. some of them, i'll admit, probably just wanna be friends with me because i was the "cool kid" in shcool or whatever. but still, it felt so good to be seen, to be recognised for something i LOVE doing.

idk

realising that this was my drive-connecting with people, making an impact-i just wanted to write this down, so i don't forget.

it's a part of me.

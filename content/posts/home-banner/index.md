#### 📌 Why I Started This Blog

initially, i started writing because i wanted to leave something behind—a way for my grandchildren or anyone curious about who i was to know me beyond just a name or a few photos (...fr). i wanted to capture my thoughts, experiences, and journey in life **so that even after i'm gone, my words will remain**.

#### ✍️ What I Learned Along the Way

over time, i realised that writing a blog wasn't just about leaving something behind—it became one of the best ways for me to reflect. sitting down to write helps me process everything—the ups and downs, what went well, what i could've done better, and how i should move forward. this habit has become something i look forward to each week, a way to slow down and think.

#### 💡 What This Blog Covers

right now, my blog is **mostly about journaling**—documenting my life and thoughts. but i also share technical insights, knowledge, and lessons i've learned along the way. everything here is a reflection of how my life unfolds, one event at a time.

#### ⏳ How Often I Write

i journal **once a week**—well, most of the time. there are weeks when life gets too hectic, and i go without writing for a while, but i always come back.

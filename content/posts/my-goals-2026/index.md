hi future me,

you are not doing great man,
you could have done so much more,
could have achieved so much more...

im totally agreeing the one point such that having too many goals let u spread ur focus "wide"
in a way that u aint gonna put 100% effort to each,
so this year, im gonna trim down my goals,
cut those unrealistic and something thats not benefitial to my long term goal.

## [Recap of 2025 goals](/my-goals-2025/)

**> Professional Goals**

**1. Ace NUS-BIT Entrance Examination & Bridging/Preparatory Courses**

> got the offer letter and successfully enrolled in july, as im writing this, im currently on my sem 2!

**2. Excel at Work**

> this goal was too broad, too vague last year -- defo not a good example to set such a vague goal,
> and ofc, the effort i put into anything not just work is always something im confident about
> and i always push myself hard for extra mile even for work

**3. Improve Communication Skills**

> communication is a life time topic for me, it's a daily skill, talking to coworkers at work, friends in the gym, and this is a skill i forsee myself to keep improving, there's so much more for me to learn every day and indeed i do believe that communication is always the key to most problems.



**> Personal Goals**

**1. Bodybuilding**

> last year, my goal, lowkey was to be able to be able to be ready to compete, that was ambitious until i realised that growing to a point where it wasn't like the first few months of me working out such that the muscle will grow in a constant speed, for now, the volume seems to be in a good fixed range that i need to focus on fine tuning them. on stats wise, i am now at ~82kg, i am always on "dirty bulk" but man, that is something i gotta be reconsider, which is to properly control my meal, even tho personally, i hate sweet stuff, i hate oily food, but i love fried stuff........


**2. Music Production**

> Fuck it.

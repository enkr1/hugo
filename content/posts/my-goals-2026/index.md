hi future me,

you weren't doing great back then. and yes, it sucked to admit that.

but here's the honest part:
it's not because you're incapable. it's because you tried to hold too many goals at once and called it "ambition".
that spreads focus wide, and then effort gets diluted into half-tries.
so this year, i am trimming the list.

fewer goals.
sharper priorities.
higher execution.

## [Recap of 2025 goals](/goals-2025/)

### Professional Goals

#### 1. Ace NUS-BIT Entrance Examination & Bridging/Preparatory Courses

achieved. got the offer letter, enrolled in july.

#### 2. Excel at Work
this was too broad and too vague. it wasn't a goal, it was a vibe.
effort was never the issue. direction and focus were.

#### 3. Improve Communication Skills
still true. communication is a daily skill: coworkers, gym friends, family, everyone.
i'm keeping this as a lifelong track, not a checkbox.



### Personal Goals
#### 1. Bodybuilding
progress is real. i am ~82kg now. strength and size are up.
but the truth: the "dirty bulk" approach is a lazy shortcut i keep defending.
i don't even like sweet stuff or oily food... but i do love fried food. that's not a plan, that's a weakness with seasoning.
2026 needs more control, not more coping.

#### 2. Music Production
i like it, but it aint a priority right now.
i'm parking it intentionally instead of pretending i'll "make time".

## Goals for 2026 ✨

### Professional Goals

this year i'm allowing myself to be ambitious, but only on the *big rocks*. P0 goals only work if they stay P0 every week, not just on the title.

but here's my long term P0 goals.

#### [P0] Launch 1 side product

* a real product (go public)
* a working v0 people can use
* at least 1 distribution channel activated (post, community, or outreach)
* at least 10 real users (not friends being polite)

##### Execution rules:
* weekly shipping: something must go live every week (even small)
* no endless rebuilding. if it works, ship it. if it's ugly, ship it. (T-shaped engineer mindset)

#### [P0] Maximise learning opportunity in NUS

* attend and prepare for tutorials/lectures properly (no last-minute panic learning)
* build at least 1 portfolio-grade artefact per term (project, write-up, or tool)
* ask better questions (not more questions): show up with attempts + reasoning

---

### Personal Goals
#### [P0] Gym
goal is not "train hard". goal is "train well".

* stay consistent all year (no mystery disappearances)
* keep bulking, but clean it up: control the food environment
* track key lifts + bodyweight trend so i'm not guessing

#### [P2] Beatbox
not dead. just not allowed to steal p0 energy.

##### Minimum maintenance:
* a 5min recording clip everyday (if i can't do even that, i'm not "busy", i'm just avoiding)

jinghui, if you're reading this later: you don't need motivation. you need a system. fewer goals. real metrics. execution.
go again, you've got this.

jing hui, i'm so damn proud of you. 🥺🌟 seriously, look at how far you've come in 2024. it's been a hell of a ride, and you've grown so much in ways you probably never thought possible. let's take a moment to really celebrate this year.

in 2024, you:

<!-- more -->

- completed the MIT IDSS Data Science and Machine Learning programme, a huge milestone that adds so much value to your journey. you didn't just do it—you crushed it. i did not regret taking up this course at all as i got to know more about AI and statistics which i have always been interested in.
- stayed consistent with journaling. i'm talking week after week, page after page, capturing life's tiny details. one day, your grandkids will be flipping through those pages, laughing and learning from your hustle.
- navigated the house-hunting game with your sister and came out closer than ever. zero drama, 100% teamwork.
- kept your gym routine alive and thriving-no excuses, even when work and life were chaotic, or even sick. progress in your fitness journey? earned. max respect to you!
- forced yourself to read in the mornings, even though some days you just said, “nah, i'll skip.” but look at the bigger picture-you still did it more often than not, and it paid off.
- judged a beatbox battle, which used to feel like a wild dream. now it's part of your story. it even pushed you to level up your own beatboxing when you saw how crazy good others were.
- invested time in researching universities—MIT, Harvard, NUS, NTU, SUSS. you finally chose NUS. that's a bold and intentional move toward your future.
- kept honing your beatboxing skills, despite juggling work, travel, and life. it might've felt slow, but real talk—you've improved and you know it.
- faced some insane challenges at ByteDance. let's be honest—there were moments you felt like an impostor. but you stepped up, took on more responsibilities, and learned to own your space.
- went to Beijing for work, navigating a different environment, proving to yourself you can handle solo travel like a champ. you also levelled up your communication skills, which you know damn well needed some work!
- built deeper connections with colleagues. shoutout to junjie for sorting out your flight and hotel details—seriously couldn't have done it without him. plus, you made some sweet memories in Beijing, from work achievements to random solo adventures.



i just want to take a moment to recognise the people who made 2024 the memorable rollercoaster it was: **my sister**, for showing me that sharing a roof can bring us closer instead of stirring up drama; **my colleagues at ByteDance, especially junjie**, for helping me navigate everything from flights to life advice; **the beatbox community**, for pushing me beyond my comfort zone and reminding me why i started beatboxing in the first place: pure passion; **my family**, who always have my back, no matter how crazy my dreams get; and, of course, **you**, jing hui, for showing up every day and giving it your all.

from all of you, i've learned that consistency wins. showing up every day—whether it's journaling, hitting the gym, or practising those beats—really works. i've also realised it's okay to feel like an impostor sometimes. if you don't feel a little fear, you're probably not growing. lean into the discomfort, and embrace the fact that challenges are just stepping stones.

but let's be real for a second—2024 wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. there were moments when you doubted yourself, felt overwhelmed, and maybe even wanted to give up. but you didn't. you kept showing up. that's the part i'm most proud of. resilience isn't flashy, but damn, it's powerful.

your biggest challenge was balancing the MIT course while delivering at ByteDance—a juggling act that left you overloaded, stressed, and on the brink of burnout more than once—but you persevered by radically rethinking your schedule and priorities.

you treated every piece of feedback like rocket fuel, knowing it would only push you to grow. you stayed flexible and open-minded, even when everything felt uncertain. you refused to be a passenger in your own life—you took the wheel and floored it. that unstoppable mindset, that unwavering grit, will definitely send you soaring even higher in 2025.

as we wrap up 2024, remember this: *you didn't just get through the year, you evolved. don't lose that drive. keep journaling, keep sweating it out in the gym, keep beatboxing until your lips go numb, and keep taking risks—even if they scare you.*

2025 is waiting for you, and i have no doubt it's gonna be bigger, crazier, and more fulfilling than ever. let's embrace whatever comes our way. 🔥

i promise to stay curious, stay resilient, and keep growing—no matter what challenges pop up. 🎯

thank you, 2024—you were wild and sometimes brutal, but i'm grateful for every lesson.

you've got this, jing hui—2025 is yours to conquer. 💪🏼📈

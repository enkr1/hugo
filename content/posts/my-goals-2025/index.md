hellu readers,

i'm thrilled to map out my plans for 2025. i find that putting my ambitions into words not only keeps me accountable but also invites meaningful conversations with those following along. if you'd like to see how i did last year, feel free to check out [my previous year's goals](/goals-2024/).

## Recap of 2024 goals

**> Professional Goals**

**1. Degree Pursuit**

> i submitted my application for NUS's [Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) programme](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-of-information-technology) and am now eagerly waiting to hear back. diving deeper into formal computer science training was a huge priority for me in 2024, and i'm excited to continue that journey this year if all goes well. 🎯



**2. Excellence at ByteDance**

> working at **ByteDance** has become more than just a job—i've embraced it as part of my lifestyle. focusing on self-management and continuous learning helped me grow significantly in 2024. i'm determined to carry that same drive into 2025 and explore new ways to push my limits.



**> Personal Goals**

**1. Financial Growth**

> i made promising strides by diversifying my income, investing in stocks, and exploring property opportunities. even though i'm still learning the ropes, i feel more confident about my path toward long-term financial security. **2025 will be about building on these foundations and staying open to new strategies.**



**2. Reading Three New Books**

> i kicked things off with *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by **Stephen Covey** and learned a lot about habit formation and mindset shifts. rather than rushing to finish a certain number of books, i'm focusing on **quality over quantity**. as **Alex Hormozi** said, "If it's worth doing, do it well." i'll continue choosing titles that spark my curiosity and contribute to my personal and professional growth.



**3. Beatbox Battle Comeback**

> though i judged many local beatbox competitions in 2024, i didn't actually make my way to compete... sadly 🥺 that said, my passion for beatboxing isn't going anywhere! in 2025, i plan to get back onstage, sharpen my skills, and rediscover the thrill of live battles. if you're curious about why i love beatboxing, you can read more [here](/why-do-i-love-beatboxing/).

## Goals for 2025

### Professional Goals

#### [P0] Ace NUS-BIT Entrance Examination & Bridging/Preparatory Courses

1. **preparation**: revise key concepts in mathematics, computer science, and programming to build a strong foundation for the entrance examination.
2. **exemptions**: aim to earn credit exemptions for fundamental modules, streamlining the path to graduation. once these bases are covered, focus on advanced core subjects to shorten the overall degree timeline.
3. **networking**: from the bridging phase onward, connect with classmates, seniors, and professors to exchange experiences and insights about upcoming modules. build valuable relationships that support both learning and future career prospects in tech.



#### [P0] Excel at Work

1. **skill development**
   - master JavaScript by producing well-structured, reusable code that reduces future workload for both me and my team. pay special attention to edge case thinking, efficiency and maintainability.
   - collaborate closely with my mentor to absorb their expertise in planning, execution, and stakeholder management—enhancing my ability to deliver projects efficiently.
2. **relationship building**
   - foster strong connections with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders through regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and knowledge-sharing (e.g., code reviews, mini workshops).
   - communicate proactively with clients, ensuring they understand goals, timelines, and challenges—transparency is key, **context not control**!
3. **performance & growth**
   - seek regular feedback from peers and supervisors, setting quarterly KPIs (OKRs) to measure progress and refine strategies.
   - use clear metrics or dashboards to track milestones and make data-driven adjustments. (THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS, A EFFICIENT WAY)
   - outline specific learning goals (e.g., certifications, new language skills) each quarter to maintain forward momentum.


> Done vs Done Well! 🚀

#### [P1] Improve Communication Skills
> i've always believed that effective communication is crucial to success, so i'm dedicating effort this year to strengthen my rapport with colleagues, friends, and family. i also want to boost my EQ and active listening skills. reading *Never Split the Difference* by **Chris Voss** really struck a chord—i tend to be more of a "win-win" person, but i'd love to adopt elements of "tactical empathy" to better understand others' perspectives.

1. **active listening**
   - paraphrase what others say to confirm understanding, and ask follow-up questions showing genuine curiosity, helping the speaker feel heard and valued.
   - watch for non-verbal cues (e.g., facial expressions, tone) for emotional context—especially important in virtual interactions (focus on voice modulation and tone).

2. **daily application**
   - apply "tactical empathy" in everyday conversations—by actively acknowledging emotions (labeling, paraphrasing, open-ended questions) to build trust and guide discussions toward collaborative solutions.
   - keep a short journal for communication hurdles, noting what worked and what didn't.
   - Set mini-goals weekly ("i'll focus on not interrupting others" or "i'll give more specific praise") to build new habits gradually.

3. **reading list**
   - revisit *Never Split the Difference* periodically, practising its techniques and adapting them to my personal style.
   - explore other communication books like *Crucial Conversations* or *How to Win Friends & Influence People*, integrating insights into real-life interactions.

4. **communication training**
   - schedule regular feedback sessions with peers or mentors to pinpoint strengths and improvement areas.
   - attend workshops or online courses that focus on negotiation, conflict resolution, and emotional intelligence.
   - consider joining public speaking clubs (like [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/)) to polish presentation skills and manage nerves in front of an audience.

### Personal Goals

#### [P0] Bodybuilding
> bodybuilding has been a big part of my life since 2022, and 2025 is the year i'm planning to go all-in.

1. **serious bulking**: invest time in creating a meal plan that helps me bulk up effectively (focusing on macros, caloric surplus, etc.).
2. **research & planning**: keep learning new techniques and verifying them with evidence-based fitness research (e.g., tracking progress, fine-tuning workout routines).
3. **consistency**: maintain a well-structured workout schedule and regularly track metrics (like weight, strength, and body composition) to see where i can improve.

#### [P2] Music Production
> i've been itching to explore music production more seriously, and now i have **FL Studio** and a solid pair of headphones ready to go.

1. **learning foundations**: deepen my understanding of digital audio workstations (DAWs) and basic music theory (e.g., chord progressions, arrangement techniques).
2. **creative projects**: work on mini-tracks or remixes, gradually building a personal portfolio i can be proud of.
3. **collaboration opportunities**: collaborate with friends, fellow producers, or even beatboxers to keep the creative energy flowing and gain fresh perspectives.

Hello, I am **Jing Hui PANG**, also known on stage as **ENKR (EnKr)**. By day, I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and by night, a passionate beatbox artist. My journey is a unique blend of technology and music, where each beat and code line creates a harmonious rhythm. This blog post delves into my personal beatbox journey, illustrating how a childhood hobby evolved into a cornerstone of my identity and helped me transform challenges into stepping stones for growth.

## Chapter 1: How It All Began
### Early Beginnings
My beatbox journey began officially when I turned 18 in 2016, but the seeds were planted much earlier. As a child, every day was a new adventure, my playroom echoing with my own sound effects. From the roaring engines of airplanes to the rhythmic beats of drums and rapid fire of toy guns, each sound was a joyous escape into a world where I was the creator of my own soundtrack. These sounds were my first unknowing steps into the world of beatboxing.

Growing up was a battle against invisible barriers. Struggling daily with **dyslexia** and **ADHD**, the simplest tasks became herculean efforts, leaving me often feeling out of step with the bustling world around me.

However, my mum made immense sacrifices, quitting her job to help me overcome these obstacles. Her dedication allowed me to learn like other kids, and I am forever grateful for her sacrifice. Despite her support, my school years were challenging. Being extremely introverted and unable to focus in class due to my ADHD, I often found myself isolated and academically behind my peers.


### A Turnaround with Beatboxing
In the midst of those stormy days, beatboxing emerged not just as a hobby but as a vital lifeline, a *rhythmic anchor* that held me steady amid the turbulence of my thoughts. Each session washed over me like a calming wave, resetting my chaotic thoughts and allowing me to focus like never before. It became my way to calm the storms in my mind. I noticed a significant change—I was calmer and could absorb knowledge from books like never before. This unique form of expression became my tool for managing stress and transforming my bursts of unfocused energy into moments of intense concentration.

### The Stage Calls
In 2016, a pivotal moment arrived with the talent show at my secondary school. Up until then, my beatboxing was a private affair, reserved for solo sessions in the bathroom or casual performances for close friends.

The very thought of stepping onto the stage, with the eyes of over 2,000 people fixed on me, was paralysing. Yet, as I took that first step into the spotlight, a thrilling rush of adrenaline overcame my fears, transforming anxiety into exhilaration.

Encouragement came from an unexpected source—my best friend, Ryan Ling. He saw something in me that I hadn't yet seen in myself. Ryan not only brought me the event poster but practically nudged me into signing up. His faith in me, combined with the support from my family and other friends who echoed his sentiments, convinced me to step out of my comfort zone.

I poured my heart and soul into preparing for the talent show. The hours spent mastering my routines paid off spectacularly—I won! That victory marked a profound transformation, not merely a triumph but a metamorphosis. In the applause of the crowd, I found not just acceptance but a new self-assurance that echoed louder than any beat I could produce. Performing on stage redefined how I saw myself and how others saw me. I went from the kid who beatboxed in solitude to a school celebrity.

### A New Chapter
The following year, I pushed my creative boundaries further by integrating beatboxing with another passion of mine, the Diabolo (Chinese Yo-Yo). I crafted a performance with my crew to combine beatboxing as background music with choreographed Diabolo routines. This innovative fusion not only entertained but *also won me accolades for the second consecutive year.*

Stepping onto that stage altered my life. I shed the skin of an introverted kid, emerging as someone new. **Beatboxing taught me to carry myself with confidence, engage with others eye-to-eye, and walk with a newfound assurance** like never before ...

## Chapter 2: Rising on a New Stage
### The Move to Singapore
In 2018, after graduating from secondary school, I embarked on a new chapter by moving to Singapore to pursue my Diploma in Information Technology. This shift was not just geographical—it was a pivotal moment in my beatbox journey. I chose Singapore for its vibrant cultural tapestry and renowned educational institutions, which I believed would provide not only a top-tier IT education but also a rich environment for my artistic pursuits.

Before this move, I had attempted to organise beatboxing gatherings back in Malaysia. Although I managed to connect with only one fellow beatboxer, Ah Yao, who was from the same state, Johor Bahru, we quickly became not just practice partners but hangout buddies, often chilling and discussing life beyond beatboxing. Despite our efforts, the vast distances between beatboxers often transformed these gatherings from hopeful plans into logistical challenges, it was really tough to see each other in person.

{% asset_img "large" "sg-1.jpg" "A view from the place of my aunt, not the place I was staying-it was place with full of memories though..."%}


### Finding New Ground
Upon arriving in Singapore, my living situation—sharing a room with relatives—posed a significant challenge. Unlike back in Malaysia, where I could freely unleash my beats at any hour, here, privacy was a rare commodity, and practicing my routines risked becoming an unwelcome disturbance. Yet, this new obstacle did nothing to dampen my passion; it only fueled my determination. I sought out public spaces where I could continue to hone my craft undisturbed. Parks, construction sites, and even the secluded toilets beside MRT stations became my sanctuaries. Night after night, I would lose myself in these improvised studios, driven by an unyielding desire to refine my skills and push my boundaries. Each session was a testament to my resolve, proving that no matter the setting, my commitment to beatboxing could turn any corner of the city into a stage for growth and expression.


### My Idols and Inspiration
During this time, I looked up to beatbox giants who shaped my artistic vision: [Alem](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Alem) from France, with his unmatched technical prowess; [Alexinho](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Alexinho), also from France, known for his dynamic freestyling and counterbeats; [NaPoM](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/NaPoM) from the USA, who mastered the deep subbass and liprolls; and Singapore's own [Piratheeban](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Piratheeban) and YK—masters in battle beatboxing and musicality, respectively. Their mastery and creativity fueled my ambition and refined my understanding of what it meant to be a beatbox artist.


### First Taste of Battle
After two years of refining my skills and performing solo, a deep-seated desire to compete took hold. Driven by curiosity one idle afternoon, I discovered a local competition organised by the Singa Beatbox Community. I registered immediately, eager for the chance to test my abilities against some of the best.

When I arrived at the competition hall at Clementi Community Centre, a sea of unfamiliar faces greeted me. Yet, despite the initial unfamiliarity, a profound connection was forged instantaneously—**our shared language of beatboxing transcended any need for words**; it was utterly surreal. Although armed with meticulously prepared routines, the sight of my idols Piratheeban and YK serving as judges was almost overwhelming. Seeing them in person, rather than through a screen, sent a surge of nerves through me that was both terrifying and exhilarating.

Their inspirational showcases, pulsing with vibrant life, transformed my nervous energy into fiery determination.

#### Piratheeban's Showcase
Witnessing Piratheeban perform live was a revelation. The clarity and volume of his performance on the microphone were astounding, starkly different from what I had heard during his battles at the [Asia Beatbox Championship 2016](https://youtu.be/vAsKOsJQMwU). Before, I had regarded him merely as a skilled beatboxer with special sounds, but that day completely altered my perception. He wasn't just skilled; he was loud and clear, he was a maestro reshaping the art form right before my eyes.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSv-VSmmQr4"></iframe>

#### YK's Showcase
And YK, his performance was akin to attending a full-blown concert. He skillfully wove his voice into his beatboxing, creating a seamless fusion that transcended traditional beatboxing—it was pure music, a beautiful symphony of human sounds. His performance underscored a powerful realisation: **Beatboxing isn't just an art form; it's a profound musical expression, beatbox is music**.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jhVxuEK6bbg"></iframe>

[The best version of Memories & Illusions by YK produced using a loopstation](https://youtu.be/xTLid3ZTSlE)

At that moment, a sudden clarity washed over me. I realised I was not there merely to compete; I was there to make a mark, to impress, and to stand out. I was determined to resonate with the beats that had fueled my countless practice sessions, to show that I too could contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of beatboxing music.

#### Moments

### Victory and Beyond
**And stand out I did. I clinched victory in the entire competition, including the tag team category**, spontaneously formed with my initial opponent. My partner, Luke Chong, proved to be an extraordinary beatboxer. Our synergy was immediate and electric, and to this day, we continue to perform together as part of a crew called Obelisk. Luke has since ascended to become the CEO of [555 Beatbox Initiatives](https://555beatboxsingapore.com/).

Claiming my first titles in both the solo and tag team categories at the Clementi Community Centre in 2018 was an unforgettable experience. The bonds formed that day have evolved into a familial crew, an extended beatbox family that still supports and grows with me. Each moment from that day is etched in my memory—a vital beat in the rhythm of my life.

This battle not only marked my entry into an incredible beatbox family but also catalysed a profound learning journey unlike any other. During the competition and in the days that followed, I actively sought advice and tips from everyone, inquiring about techniques that had eluded me for years. The community was eager to share, allowing me to grasp nuances and sounds on the spot—a stark contrast to the solitary hours spent deciphering techniques from YouTube videos back home. This vibrant, supportive community has grown stronger over time, and our connections extend far beyond mere beatboxing. We are more than friends who share a passion; we are a family united by rhythm and mutual respect, continually inspiring each other to new heights, We are rising 555.

## Chapter 3: In the Arena
### 2019 - What a Year
In 2019, I achieved three prestigious titles, each marking a significant milestone in my beatbox career:
- **Champion of Radiance Beatbox Jam 2019, Singapore.**
- **Champion of A Cappella Beatbox Championship 2019, Singapore.**
- **Champion of Cypher Beatbox Battle 2019, Singapore.**

This period was both brief and seemingly endless, filled with memorable moments that I treasure to this day. I vividly recall the technical discussions and strategy exchanges with my crew before each battle and the invaluable reflections afterward. That year, I also set my sights on competing in the [Werewolf Beatbox Championship, Indonesia](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf_Beatbox_Championship_2019), which featured a panel of judges who are legends in the beatbox community, including Alem, [Dlow](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/D-low), Mad Twinz, and [Pepouni](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Pepouni).



### Radiance Beatbox Jam 2019, Singapore
This event was among the first organised by the 555 Beatbox Initiative. We dedicated immense effort to ensure its success, and it was a resounding hit within the community.

### Champion of A Cappella Beatbox Championship 2019, Singapore
This championship is unforgettable, not only because of the competition but also for the unique collaboration with my team, **Von Appeti**, from Singapore Polytechnic. Competing as a bass and vocal percussionist in the a cappella category alongside beatboxing was a thrilling challenge. This dual role allowed us to blend traditional beatboxing with harmonic group performance, creating a fusion that was both exhilarating and artistically enriching.

In our ensemble of five, two of us could beatbox, showcasing the diversity and talent within our group. This camaraderie offered a fantastic opportunity to exchange skills and learn from one another. A standout moment was our cover of "Titanium," where I switched roles from bass to vocal percussion mid-performance, igniting the audience with excitement.

The finals posed a formidable challenge against **KK**, one of the most musically gifted beatboxers I've encountered. His unique style, characterised by powerful musicality and solid beats, heightened the competition's intensity. Truthfully, I hadn't anticipated winning given KK's exceptional talent; the battle felt like an uphill struggle. However, the victory not only affirmed my skills but also offered a profound learning experience about resilience and mastering the art of beatboxing under pressure.

Additionally, the competition was a double triumph for me. Alongside Luke Chong (HandFx), under our tag team name **Vonderie**, we clinched victory in the tag team category as well. Winning both the solo and tag team competitions was an exhilarating affirmation of our hard work and synergy.

### Champion of Cypher Beatbox Battle 2019, Singapore
This competition was undoubtedly a pinnacle of my beatboxing year. The judging panel boasted the formidable YK and [Zhang Ze](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Zhang_Ze), a titan in the international beatboxing scene. Zhang Ze's accolades are impressive: a three-time Champion of the China Beatbox Championship (2014, 2015, & 2016) and one half of the renowned tag team A&Z, which shook the global beatboxing community at GBB 2017 with their innovative techniques and compelling performances, [A&Z (ZHANG ZE & AH XIN) | Grand Beatbox TAG TEAM Battle 2017 | Elimination](https://youtu.be/mrK-qDoMKLk). Knowing the caliber of expertise Zhang Ze brought to the table, my nerves were taut with a palpable mix of anticipation and exhilaration—this was more than just another competition, it was a test against a standard set by one of the best.

#### Zhang Ze's Showcase

#### YK's Showcase

The finals presented not merely a battle, but an extraordinary confrontation with **Varen**, who was more than just a rival; he was one of my dearest friends and a trusted crewmate from Obelisk. Our friendship, built on mutual respect and shared experiences, only amplified the intensity of the competition. Each performance was not just about showcasing our skills but also about honouring our shared journey in beatboxing. The atmosphere was electric, filled with the energy of fierce competition intertwined with the warmth of brotherly respect. It was a display of high-caliber beatboxing where each drop and beat resonated more profoundly because of our personal connections. This battle pushed both of us to the limits of our creativity and technical skills, turning the event into an unforgettable spectacle of artistry and friendship.

### Werewolf Beatbox Championship 2019, Indonesia

[The Werewolf Beatbox Championship 2019 in Indonesia](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf_Beatbox_Championship_2019) was a landmark event for me, marking the final competition I would participate in before starting my full-time job as a Software Engineer. With my upcoming hectic schedule, I was determined to end this chapter of my competitive beatboxing journey on a high note.

Encouraging my 555 community to join, we submitted our wildcards together. For those unfamiliar, a beatbox wildcard is an entry ticket used to eliminate participants online. Instead of merely registering, beatboxers must publish a 1:30-minute video showcasing their skills, along with a short self-introduction. The organisation then selects qualifiers based on these wildcards. Our commitment and enthusiasm were evident—we even bought our flight tickets before knowing if we had qualified. The community spirit was palpable, and we were eager to experience an international stage together.

The [judges panel](https://beatbox.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolf_Beatbox_Championship_2019#Judges)—Pepouni, Alem, D-low, Pash, and Jayton—comprised idols, teachers, and inspirations I had only seen on YouTube. Now, they were coming to Asia, and I couldn't miss the opportunity to meet them.

I submitted my solo beatbox wildcard with a one-take video, reflecting my preparation and confidence. Here's my beatbox wildcard:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xc16ZTsG3Cw?si=sX3jy3e_7v2qzkTb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Although I was well-prepared, the competition was fierce, and I didn't qualify for the solo category. Surprisingly, this mixed feeling of sadness and happiness washed over me. I was disappointed but also thrilled to immerse myself in the event, enjoy the judges' showcases, and relish being part of the crowd.

However, I did qualify for the tag team category with my partner, HandFx, under our team name [Vonderie](https://www.instagram.com/555vonderie/). Here's our wildcard:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bFeZixXrr4?si=7RXVjwtAluoPZvic" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The tag team experience was incredible, and we unexpectedly made it to the semi-finals. It was a surreal and joyous journey.


#### Battling Equinox

As you can see at the ending, our surprise and excitement were evident when we qualified to move on.


#### Battling Vocalizm

This event was a milestone in the Indonesia beatbox community, featuring not only intense battles but also inspiring showcases from the judges. Alem, D-low, Pash, and Jayton brought their unique styles and expertise, creating an electrifying atmosphere that motivated all participants to bring their best performances. Witnessing their live showcases was a highlight; each performance was a masterclass in beatboxing, demonstrating advanced techniques and musicality that left the audience in awe.

The sense of community among beatboxers was profound. Despite being competitors, we shared tips, experiences, and unwavering support, forging bonds that extended beyond the competition itself. This event was not just about winning; it was about personal growth, pushing the boundaries of my beatboxing abilities, and understanding the power of community support in achieving one's goals.

The Werewolf Beatbox Championship 2019 will always be a cherished memory, marking the culmination of my competitive beatboxing journey and the beginning of a new chapter in my life as a Software Engineer. It was a perfect blend of challenge, learning, and community, leaving a lasting impact on my personal and artistic growth. Participating in this competition was an incredible experience, testing my skills against some of the best beatboxers in the region. Competing on an international stage brought new challenges and learning opportunities, pushing me to innovate and refine my approach. The camaraderie and exchange of ideas with beatboxers from different backgrounds enriched my perspective and expanded my repertoire.

## Now: The Beat Goes On - Reflections and Aspirations

Beatboxing was more than just a musical pursuit; it became a transformative force in my life, moulding me into the person I am today. Without it, I wouldn't recognise myself. **It's not merely a part of my life; it has crafted a life—a unique rhythm all my own.**

Reflecting on my beatboxing journey, each competition, performance, and practice session has been a step in my transformative journey. From the solitude of my childhood beatboxing sessions to the vibrant stages of international competitions, beatboxing has been a constant source of growth and empowerment.

Throughout this journey, I have been honoured to achieve significant milestones. I became the Champion of Clementi Community Centre 2018 in Singapore, and in 2019, I triumphed in multiple events: Radiance Beatbox Jam, A Cappella Beatbox Championship, and Cypher Beatbox Battle, all in Singapore. Additionally, I reached the Top 16 at the Armageddon International Beatbox Battle in Malaysia and the Top 8 at The Capital Beatbox Battle in Malaysia. In 2021, I earned the title of Vice Champion at the A Cappella Beatbox Championship in Singapore. In the tag team category, my partner and I, under the team name Vonderie, claimed victory at the A Cappella Beatbox Battle 2019 in Singapore and reached the Top 4 at the Werewolf Beatbox Championship 2019 in Indonesia.

These achievements are not just titles; they represent the culmination of hard work, dedication, and the unwavering support of my community. They are milestones that mark the peaks of my beatboxing life, each one a testament to the power of passion and perseverance. However, my journey is far from over. As I continue to hone my craft, I aspire to push the boundaries of beatboxing further. I aim to collaborate with other artists, explore new genres, and bring beatboxing to new audiences. The rhythm of my beats is a reflection of my life's journey, and I am excited to see where it takes me next.

**Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way**—my family, friends, and fans. Your encouragement and belief in me have been instrumental in my success. *Here's to the beats that keep us moving forward, one rhythm at a time.*

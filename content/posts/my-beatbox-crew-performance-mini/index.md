Hello everyone! It's ENKR (Jing Hui PANG) here, and I'm thrilled to share my recent experience at the launch event for the [new MINI family](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/asia/article/detail/T0443854EN/new-look-new-attitude-new-era:-the-new-mini-family-now-available-in-singapore?language=en). Alongside my crew, **Obelisk**, we delivered three electrifying performances on 19th July 2024, at 11 am, 8 pm, and 8:30 pm. Being part of this event was not just thrilling but also a significant opportunity for personal and professional growth.

Who are we? [Obelisk](https://www.instagram.com/555obelisk/) is the first beatbox crew from Singapore, formed in 2024 by five passionate beatboxers: Clarkceds, ENKR, HandFx, Inovity, and Varen. Together, we bring a unique blend of styles and skills to every performance, pushing the boundaries of what beatboxing can achieve.



## Insights from the Event

The launch event wasn't just about showcasing a new car; it was a learning experience filled with moments of growth and collaboration.



### Learning from the Best: Stage Manager - Cash

One of the standout moments was working closely with Cash, the stage manager. His expertise and deep understanding of stage management, beatbox performance, and DJ-ing were truly inspiring. Cash's versatility and skill level are impressive, and I gained a lot from observing and collaborating with him. He's an absolute beast in his field, and his knowledge is vast and invaluable.



### Team Effort and Achievement

Despite having only close to a month and practising once or twice a week, our team managed to deliver a performance that we are all incredibly proud of. We prepared three dynamic 15-minute sets, each featuring a unique blend of songs that showcased our versatility and creativity:

1. **Mini Themed Rap Song** - Lyrics written by [Minian](https://555beatboxsingapore.com/artists/minian/)
2. **Style** - Taiki Nulight, P Money, Capo Lee
3. **UP!** - Forrest Frank, Connor Price - Fully arranged by [ALC](https://www.instagram.com/alc_bbx/)
4. **Hydrate** - Skrillex, Flowdan, BEAM, PEEKABOO
5. **Beggin'** - The Tech Thieves, Besomage, Meric Again
6. **Spinnin** - Connor Price, Bens

The dedication and hard work from every team member were truly inspiring. Our collective effort and the synergy we built in such a short time were nothing short of phenomenal. We had to meticulously coordinate our beats, sync our rhythms, and ensure every aspect of our performance was tight and cohesive. This intense collaboration and commitment led to a performance that exceeded our expectations and became a highlight of my journey.

I am deeply grateful to each member of the team for their passion and perseverance. Their unwavering dedication made this achievement possible and highlighted the power of teamwork and collaboration. This experience has not only strengthened our bond as a crew but also reinforced my belief in the magic that happens when talented individuals come together with a shared goal.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this event such a success. Your hard work and enthusiasm have made a lasting impact, and I couldn't be happier with what we've accomplished together.



### The Energy of the Event

The atmosphere at the event was electric. The excitement of unveiling the new all-electric MINI Cooper added a unique buzz to the air. We felt the anticipation and the energy of the audience, which fueled our performance. It was a privilege to contribute to the event's success with our beatbox performance.

However, the energy at this event was different from any performance we've had before. We were performing for business partners, affluent individuals, and professionals who, (i think) due to their roles, some of them might have needed to maintain a more reserved demeanour. Unlike previous shows where the audience's enthusiasm was more openly expressed, this crowd had a distinct, subdued energy.

Despite this, the audience still provided us with the energy we needed. From the first set, we quickly realised that performing for different types of crowds requires adjusting our approach to maintain the energy on stage. For this particular audience, we found that we had to generate and sustain the energy from within ourselves rather than relying on the crowd's outward reactions.

This experience taught us a valuable lesson in adaptability and stage presence. We learnt that when faced with a more reserved audience, it is crucial to create and maintain high energy among the performers. This internal energy becomes infectious, subtly influencing the audience and enhancing the overall performance.

Adding to the challenge, the event was held in the central area of a public mall. This required us to engage not just the VIPs seated in front of us, but also the passersby and shoppers surrounding the performance space. It was quite fun to look around 360 degrees and connect with a diverse audience spread all around us.

By the time we reached our second and third sets, we had fully embraced this approach. We focused on our own synergy, feeding off each other's enthusiasm and passion. This self-generated energy not only kept our performance dynamic but also gradually drew more visible reactions from the audience. It was a powerful reminder of the importance of performer-driven energy and the ability to adapt to different audience dynamics.

In conclusion, performing at the MINI Cooper launch was a unique and enriching experience. It reinforced the significance of internal energy and adaptability in delivering a captivating performance, regardless of the audience's initial reactions. This event will always be remembered as a highlight in our journey, teaching us to find new ways to connect with and energise our audience.



## Reflections

This experience has reinforced the importance of teamwork, dedication, and learning from those around you. It's moments like these that remind me why I love what I do. The thrill of being part of something bigger, the joy of collaborating with talented individuals, and the satisfaction of achieving a shared goal are truly priceless.

Being part of this event also reminded me of my previous blog post, ["My Beatbox Journey: From Solitude to the Stage"](/my-beatbox-journey-from-solitude-to-the-stage), where I shared how beatboxing transformed my life. This recent experience is another milestone in that journey, showing how far I've come and how much I've learnt.

## Professional Goals
### Degree Pursuit
In 2024, I am determined to enroll in and excel in a **Computer Science** degree program to solidify my technical foundation. Learning on the job has been an incredible experience for me, and I have developed a strong understanding of **what** needs to be done and **how** to do it, despite lacking some "low-level" knowledge.

In my opinion, pursuing this degree will not only validate and showcase my abilities but also open up new career opportunities and help me forge valuable connections along the way. I am confident that formal certification will strengthen my expertise and position me for future success.

Currently, I am looking at some local unis e.g. [National University of Singapore (NUS) Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) programme](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-of-information-technology), NTU and SUSS.

<!-- - [Harvard's Summer 2024 Academic Calendar](https://summer.harvard.edu/adult-college-students/calendar/) -->

#### Action Plan:
- **Research Programs**: Identify and compare different Computer Science degree programs to find the best fit.
- **Prepare Application Materials**: Update my CV, write personal statements, and gather recommendation letters.
- **Enroll in Preparatory Courses**: Take online courses to brush up on foundational topics.
- **Plan Finances**: Explore scholarships, grants, and savings options to fund my education.
- **Time Management**: Develop a study schedule that balances work and coursework effectively.


### Excellence at ByteDance
Having joined ByteDance on 18 December 2023, I aim to become an exemplary project manager, software engineer and aPaaS consultant, setting a high standard for my peers and fellow ByteDancers. With a background as a project manager and technical leader, transitioning back to a developer role feels quite unusual. I am now focusing mainly on self-management rather than code reviewing, which I used to do extensively with my colleagues at my previous company. However, I am confident in my ability to excel through self-management and focus on continuous improvement. This role presents a unique challenge to my practical skills as a "good" software engineer, but I recognise the importance of soft skills in achieving success. I am eager to improve these skills as I strongly believe they are essential for my professional growth. I am committed to mastering them to reach my career goals!


#### Action Plan:
- **Set Clear Objectives**: Define specific, measurable goals for my role as a software engineer and project manager.
- **Continuous Learning**: Attend workshops, webinars, and training sessions to enhance my technical and soft skills.
- **Seek Feedback**: Regularly ask for feedback from peers and supervisors to identify areas for improvement.
- **Networking**: Build relationships with colleagues and industry professionals to expand my network.
- **Time Management**: Implement effective time management strategies to balance coding and project management responsibilities.
- **Soft Skills Development**: Focus on communication, teamwork, and leadership skills through practice and reflection.

## Personal Goals
### Financial Growth
I have started looking into investments, a goal I have had even before I began working. As a student, I focused on saving to pay off my student loans and support my family, leaving little extra money to invest. Although the idea of investing was always in my mind, I couldn't act on it until now.

This year, I finally have some savings set aside to begin investing and diversify my income sources. My goal is to secure long-term financial stability. I am exploring various investment opportunities such as stocks, housing, and more. This is the year for me to take decisive steps towards financial growth, and I am committed to drafting a detailed plan to achieve this goal!


#### Action Plan:
- **Educate Myself**: Read books, take online courses, and follow financial experts to build a solid understanding of investment strategies.
- **Set Financial Goals**: Define clear, measurable financial goals for the short term and long term.
- **Create a Budget**: Develop a budget that allocates a portion of my income to investments.
- **Diversify Investments**: Research and invest in a mix of stocks, real estate, and other assets to spread risk.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review my investments and make adjustments based on performance and market trends.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with "financial advisors" to refine my investment strategy and ensure I am on the right track.


### Read 3 New Books
Currently, I am reading *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen Covey. I am applying the first three habits in my everyday life, and while it is going well, I find it challenging at times. Right now, I am on Habit 4, which is about thinking Win-Win. This concept conflicts somewhat with ideas from *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss, a book I greatly appreciated. I am still digesting the ideas and core concepts, finding them intriguing because I have noticed these habits in many successful people I have spoken with.


#### Action Plan:
- Finish **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey** by June: Focus on understanding and applying all seven habits.
- Explore recommendations and choose a book that aligns with my interests and goals. Some books in mind:
  - **The Diary of a CEO** by Steven Bartlett
  - **Critical Thinking: Your Guide to Effective Argument, Successful Analysis and Independent Study** by Tom Chatfield
  - **Being Logical: A Guide to Good Thinking** by D.Q. McInerny
  - **Thinking, Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman
  - **100M Offers** by Alex Hormozi
  - **Atomic Habits** by James Clear: A great read on building good habits and breaking bad ones.
  - **Deep Work** by Cal Newport: Ideal for enhancing focus and productivity.
  - **Thinking, Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman: Offers insights into how our minds work and how to make better decisions.
  - **How to Win Friends & Influence People** by Dale Carnegie: Learn how to build better relationships and communicate effectively.
  - **Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker** - Kevin D. Mitnick, Steve Wozniak (Foreword), William L. Simon (Primary Contributor) - [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10256723-ghost-in-the-wires)

### Competing in Beatbox Battle Once Again!
As I have been dedicating my time to professional growth, I rarely had a chance to invest my time in practising like I used to... Back in secondary school, I would beatbox for **8 hours a day** after completing my homework. **Yes, 8 hours** - I ain't kidding. I genuinely loved beatboxing, but I can sense my passion for it slowly fading.

#### Action Plan:
- **Set Practice Goals**: Allocate specific times each week for beatboxing practice to rekindle my passion.
- **Participate More Beatbox Events**: Connect with local or online beatboxing communities to stay motivated and learn new techniques.
- **Participate in Battles**: Enter local and online beatbox competitions to challenge myself and showcase my skills.
- **Record and Review**: Regularly record my sessions to track progress and identify areas for improvement.
- **Incorporate Beatboxing into Daily Life**: Find small opportunities throughout the day to practice, such as while commuting or during breaks.

## Other Goals in the Pipeline (2025)
In addition to my professional and personal goals, I am also exploring new hobbies and skills to enhance my creativity and well-being outside of work.

### Music Production
I have already taken the first step towards music production by purchasing FL Studio and a quality pair of headphones. I was ready to dive into it, but my job hunting took priority (you can read more about this in a future blog post, where I will share my experiences during the tech job crisis and my job transition). Although it is not a focus for 2024, I am excited to eventually explore this creative outlet.

### Bodybuilding
Since mid-2022, I have been working out seriously, and bodybuilding has become a significant part of my lifestyle. Although it is not my top priority for 2024, I have ambitious goals for the future. I aspire to become one of the best bodybuilders, starting in Singapore and eventually competing on a global level. This is a long-term goal that I am passionate about.

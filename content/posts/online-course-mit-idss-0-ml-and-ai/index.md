## First Impressions: Introduction to Python
The program kicked off with an orientation followed by our first session, "**Prework - Introduction to Python**". This session was designed to lay the groundwork for upcoming topics and refresh fundamental programming skills. As someone who already possesses a solid foundation in programming, the content felt quite basic. However, revisiting these fundamentals is always beneficial in strengthening my understanding and ensuring no detail is overlooked.

Despite the straightforward nature of the material, the first mentored session did not quite meet my expectations in terms of interaction. It felt more like a standard online course rather than an engaging classroom experience. This *lack of dynamic interaction was a bit of a letdown, yet I am optimistic about future sessions*. I look forward to them fostering a more collaborative and engaging atmosphere, one that is crucial for deeper learning and professional growth.


## My Plan
Accoridng to my schedule:

I want to make the most out of this program and I have set a few personal goals:
1. **Engage Fully**: Actively participate in all mentored learning sessions and group discussions.
2. **Stay Organised**: Keep up with the weekly schedule and assessments to avoid falling below total score of 95% and to keep attendance at 100%.
3. **Apply Learning**: Implement concepts through personal projects or at my current job to solidify understanding whenever its possible!


## Conclusion: A Journey of Learning and Growth
For me, this program extends beyond just mastering algorithms or enhancing my Python coding skills; it's about grasping the broader impact of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in tackling real-world challenges. I am eager to discover where this journey will take me and how it will refine my contributions to the field of data science.

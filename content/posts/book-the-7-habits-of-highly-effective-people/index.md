## Overview

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

Habits = knowledge (what to, why to) + desire (want to) + skill (how to)

it is a painful process, it is a change that has to be motivated by higher purpose, by willingness to subordinate what you think you want now for what you want later.

Happiness can be defined, in part at least, as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually.

- **dependent** is the paradigm of you-you take care of me; you come through for me; you did not come through; I blame you for the result.
- **independent** is the paradigm of I-I can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose.
- **interdependent** is the paradigm of we-we can do it; we can cooperate; we can combine our talents and abilities and create something greater together.

## ✨ Highlights of the Week

aside from my usual work grind, the true highlight this week was reuniting with my ex-colleagues—lionel, wai chun, kenny chan, and ze hung! 🥺

![not the full squad, but it was such a meaningful catch-up. chatting with the people who shaped me both personally and professionally into who i am today—these moments hit different... 🥹](IMG_5102.jpeg)

i'm not usually the emotional type, but small moments like these? they feel like a warm hug. hearing how well everyone's doing (and yeah, catching up on some workplace gossip too—classic HAHA) just fills my heart in a way that's hard to explain.

work was fun back then, and it still is now—but in different ways.

i really believe that reminiscing about the past is a powerful way to stay grounded and motivated in the present. looking back on how lucky i was to work with such incredible people reminds me how lucky i still am—to be doing what i love, surrounded by good energy. 🥹



**what did they teach me that i still carry today? 🌱**

- **lionel aimerie**—pixium's CTO, my direct leader, the one who taught me 90% of what i know today. fullstack in PHP, JS, a little React, and most importantly, Elixir Phoenix. we started phoenix together—researching, building from the ground up, figuring things out side by side. what i carry from him? **never fear the unknown—break it down, learn it, build with it.**

- **wai chun**—my senior, my day-one mentor, still guiding me in spirit. back in the covid wfh days, i asked him a question about ssh keys. instead of just telling me to google it, this man wrote me an essay. pure effort, pure kindness, no GPT back then. what i carry from him? **patience, generosity, and the power of sharing knowledge selflessly.**

- **kenny chan**—the people person. the one with all the soft skills i've always admired. presentation, people, sales—he can talk to literally anyone and make them feel at ease. calm, steady, composed. what i carry from him? **the importance of presence—how you show up, how you connect with others.**

- **ze hung**—new blood when i was about to leave pixium, but man, did he leave an impression. solo-ing flutter projects, carrying them on his back, and never afraid to stand up for what he believes. he challenged requirements, asked the hard questions. what i carry from him? **courage—to question, to stand my ground, to not just accept but understand.**

- **médéric**—CSO, security pro, the one who taught me react, next.js, vim, bash, scripting, devops, aws, terraform, how to deploy php yii2 apps, how to talk to clients. had my first client lunch with him. and outside work? party animal! 🤣 he broke every tech stereotype i had. what i carry from him? **balance. be sharp in your craft, but never forget to live.**

🌱 these people built pieces of my foundation. their lessons are in me, every day.

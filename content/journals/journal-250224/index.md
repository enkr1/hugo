## ✨ Highlights of the Week

another hectic week, but honestly, one of the most productive ones in a while! i really felt like i was in the zone—managed to squeeze in a lot of things and complete everything i had planned. ☺️

aside from work, i finally set aside a night to discuss our upcoming phuket trip in march with vinoth & yousheng! it's always exciting to have something to look forward to.

also! i gave my bro a comprehensive leg day breakdown!

he's currently in spain for his degree, so we had to do it over a video call, which was a completely different experience compared to my previous sharing session with toby, where we did it in person. explaining movements virtually made me realise how important it is to be concise and clear—i had to be extra mindful of my words to ensure my explanations made sense without demonstrating in real time. i found this challenge really interesting and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable!

being a personal trainer has always been something i'm passionate about. not because i want to make it a career, but because i love sharing my knowledge and experience with others—helping them avoid the same mistakes i made, guiding them towards better progress, and seeing them grow in their own journey. witnessing someone improve because of something i taught them? that's one of the best feelings ever. 🥹

it also reinforces my own understanding of fitness. as Steve Bartlett mentioned in his book, if you want to truly master something, you need to be able to teach it to others. i can really see the truth in that now.

it also deepens my own understanding of fitness. as Steven Bartlett mentioned in his book, if you want to truly master something, you need to be able to teach it to others. this concept has always been in me, but experiencing it firsthand through coaching hits differently—it's a reminder that teaching doesn't just help others grow, "when one person is teaching, two people learn", it solidifies my own knowledge too.



## 📝 Reading Insights

this week, i revisited chapter 5 of Never Split the Difference—"Triggering the Two Words That Immediately Transform Any Negotiation." i've been actively trying to apply the paraphrasing + labeling technique to summarise conversations better. the idea is to not just restate what was said but also acknowledge the emotions behind it—this makes the other person feel truly heard.

it's definitely not an easy skill to master, but i can see myself improving. learning how to communicate effectively has been one of my biggest goals this year, and this small tweak in how i summarise conversations is already making a difference.

## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this week was intense... a full 7/7 work grind 😔 by friday nightm i was so wiped out that i just passed out like that and slept for more than 9 hours straight! woke up and barely had time to catch my breath before rushing off to work again.

even though it was hectic, i found a bit of thrill in the unknown challenges and a sense of satisfaction in pushing through. 🎯💪🏼🔥

AND guess what! F26 canteen is gonna reopen next week! OMG finally! 😭🤞🏼

for my beatboxing practice, with 25 days until the comp and 14 days left to finish my wildcard, i'm giving it my all. i'm trusting the process, feeling like i'm hitting a low right before the climb. it's that moment when u're going down the hill, but i'm so ready to rise any time! 🔥

watch me.



## 📝 Reading Insights

i have been revisiting the book *Never Split the Difference* by Christopher Voss, a book that's almost become a life strategy guide for me. i know relying heavily on one book isn't ideal, but i find myself **taking the parts that resonate, filtering what feels right, and testing out those ideas in real life**. some of the techniques? they actually work wonders in human interactions—it's fascinating.

rereading has been a refreshing way to catch details i might have missed the first time. it's funny how information can just slip through ur mind without u even noticing, so a good review always feels worthwhile. 📝

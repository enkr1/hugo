i'm starting a new adventure: journalling! i want to jot down the interesting things i learn and experience every week. hopefully, this will become a habit, and maybe i'll even start doing it daily.

why am i doing this? honestly, i'm not sure. but i feel like sharing my weekly and daily discoveries with everyone could be fun and insightful. let's see where this journey takes us!

## ✨ Highlights of the Week

- **Beatboxing**: got back into beatboxing. it felt so good to practise again.
- **Quality Time**: caught up with an old friend and spent some cherished moments with family.
- **Work**: Productive week, amazing session and great ideas are brewing!



## Little Lesson

this week i learnt from my sister that when you want to convince someone on a specific topic, don't straight up jump into the concept you think they'll agree on. first, ask if they're thinking in that direction. so, thinking out loud is good but always clarify first.

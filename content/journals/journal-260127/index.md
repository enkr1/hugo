## ✨ Highlights of the Week

one thing i'm really grateful for last week was staying back to listen to the questions other students asked.

i realised how insightful it is to hear different ways of thinking, different angles, different mental models. it keeps reminding me that not everyone thinks the same way i do. sometimes, the things i don't understand, the ones i get stuck on for way too long, aren't meant to be brute-forced. sometimes, the best thing to do is just to sit down, calm down, and try looking at the problem from a completely different perspective.

other than that, last week was honestly amazing. a productive one. i've been learning math for computing: propositions, predicates, all that, and i am genuinely excited for the in-person lesson tomorrow. i kinda love the lecturer's energy too.

and it hit me that i really am so lucky. so far, my lecturers carry so much passion for what they teach. i even had the chance to join jiangkan for lunch after lecture, and that was such a good experience. being able to talk to your professor like that, to hear their stories, understand their journey, exchange views on past experiences and the current industry -- it's something i don't take lightly.

i really love connecting with people.

i should do this more.

and growth doesn’t come from talking more, but from **listening longer**

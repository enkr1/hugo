## ✨ Highlights of the Week

i completely forgot to mention something from the previous week—it slipped my mind while writing! 💀 i guess the gym story took the spotlight for me.

i had the honour of being a judge at the [Ignition Beatbox Academy Event](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAI7HN8IOxN/) by the [555 Beatbox Initiative](https://555beatboxsingapore.com/) on 12th October 2024. the judging panel included Clarkceds, Varen, and myself, and it was such a privilege to be a part of it. we judged the level 2 students' showcases and the level 3 battle. watching them perform was a proud moment. i still remember seeing some of these students on their first day, and now, to witness how far they've come—it's honestly incredible.

okay, let's talk about this week!

this week was pretty chill overall. i had a few gym sessions with Inovity, and honestly, having someone push you to failure just hits different! 🔥

seeing my coworkers travelling for business trips did make me feel a little envious—i'd love to go on one soon. they've been travelling so often, and i'm really happy for them! i'm just waiting for my chance and feeling excited for whenever that happens, or maybe i will have to fight for it? idk, it is a mix of feelings 🥹🤞🏼 but at the end of the day, i know that everyone has their own timing. i will keep pushing myself and doing my best, knowing that my opportunity will come when it is meant to. turning that envy into motivation is what keeps me going—i have learned to celebrate others while still working towards my own goals. 🫶🏻

on the work front, i've been feeling more motivated and super productive. i made it a point to be proactive, asking more questions (not the dumb kind tho 😂). i always try things myself first before seeking help.

overall, this week was a productive one!

下周继续加油 竞辉！💪🏼

> i was really touched when i saw this security guard helping a lady with her baby stroller on the escalator. she was holding a baby, with two other kids around, and this moment just felt so heartwarming. 🥺

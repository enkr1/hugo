## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this week, my priorities were on: work, gym and prepping myself for the beatbox competition i'm planning to participate. to top it off... 6th december is my birthday too! UGH

it's been over 3 years since i last battled, and i can't even begin to explain how much i miss it—the rush of adrenaline when you're on stage, the energy from the crowd, and the vibe from all the other beatboxers. it's not just the competition; it's the whole experience that i miss so much.

i've been putting in a lot of effort lately, but, to be honest, it still feels like i could do more... but, balancing everything—work, gym, and beatboxing—is tough. after a long day at work, it's straight to the gym, and only after that do i get the time to practise beatboxing. but i know it's all about mental. the grind never stops, and i have to push through it.

my biggest challenge right now is breaking out of my usual beats and trying to create something new. it's been about 20 days of trying, and i'm still struggling to come up with fresh routines. it's frustrating, but i know this is the part of the process where many people give up. this feeling of being stuck—that's the moment when you're on the verge of a breakthrough. if i can just push past this, i know success is just around the corner.

i got this. 🙌



## 📝 Reading Insights

> "The sole reason of why people procrastinate is because they're trying to avoid some form of ‘psyhological discomfort' in their life. The bigger the task and the less competent we feel about accomplishing it, the greater the procrastination."

this quote really struck me. i could feel it resonate in my daily life, especially when it comes to things like hitting the snooze button in the morning or mindlessly scrolling through 抖音 and instagram reels. it's like i'm delaying that sense of discomfort, avoiding the challenge ahead, even though i know it's not helping me in the long run.

i know i am not alone in this, and that gives me a bit of comfort. but i also know this is a process, one that takes time and self-awareness. i'm working on it—slowly, but surely. recognising this psychological discomfort as the root of procrastination is already a step forward for me. the next step is taking action, even when i don't feel ready, and learning to push through that initial resistance. it's a journey of self-discipline and growth.

i'm not perfect—there are still days when i fall into old habits, but understanding why i procrastinate has shifted my mindset. i've come to realise that it's not about eliminating procrastination overnight, but about **improving little by little**, showing up even on the hard days, and building momentum. one small victory at a time. 🌱

at the end of the day, **progress over perfection** is what really matters. so, while i might still have moments of distraction or hesitation, i'm committed to pushing through and becoming the best version of myself, one day at a time.

## ✨ Highlights of the Week

the first part of the week was packed with practices and preparation for the countdown performance. since i had just returned from my beijing trip, i was a bit behind on the crew's routines and didn't get a chance to practise with them earlier. it felt like i had to play catch-up, so i put in extra effort to get back on track. despite the challenges, we pulled it off, and the performance went really well. the fireworks were lovely, and the energy of the crowd was incredible. being part of the team and performing on stage was such a rewarding experience, and we really really did so well! so proud of us! 🎉

even after the performance, i managed to squeeze in some gym time—because dedication doesn't take a break! the rest of the week was about catching up on sleep and easing back into my usual routine of work and gym.

i also started a loading phase of ~20g of creatine per day for 7 days, beginning on 3rd january 2025. on top of that, i tried a new protein shake flavour (surprisingly good) and treated myself to a late-night mcd's supper—it's all about balance, right? 🙊

overall, it was a short but fulfilling week, blending beatboxing, fitness, and a bit of relaxation. can't wait to see what the next week brings!

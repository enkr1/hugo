hi readers,

wow. it's been... more than 2 months since my last journal.

definitely feels weird to not write anything, really weird.

even though i know-it's probably just me who'll be reading this in the future. and maybe that's enough.

where did i go? what's been keeping me busy?

i disappeared for something big, something great. since around march or april, i've been pouring 200% of my focus into it.

and to myself:

> jinghui, you’re doing amazing. keep going - good things are on their way.

what i've been up to:

1. made a **BIG decision**
2. been preparing for my upcoming **university programme**
3. catching up with the latest **AI trends**—lots of readings, lots of coding!

i just feel like... there's still so much to learn.

sometimes, i really wish i could buy myself more time. ⏳

but hey-

> you've been doing great, jinghui.
>
> keep growing. keep showing up.
>
> and don't stop believing in yourself. 🌱

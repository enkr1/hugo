## ✨ Highlights of the Week

met up with my friends - desmond, darren, and grace - last week, and had such a good time catching up. it genuinely made me happy to see that they’re all doing well and living their own lives happily. 🥹 moments like this always ground me.

first week of school also started off strong. i did put in much more effort and focus this time, felt really productive. i sacrificed quite a few things, tried hard not to waste time on youtube, ig, 抖音… tho let's be real, for me, the hardest battle is still waking up in the morning T\_T

for my studying workflow, i think i've found something really solid. i now have what feels like an actual study assistant with long-term memory - and omg, i am only in week 2 but the difference already feels insane. after a few more weeks, i'd really love to write about this properly and share what's working for me. but for now… LFGG jinghui!!! keep learning!!!!!! 🚀\
also… only in my second semester did i realise you can export calendar events directly from canvas 💀 bro… i *really* wish i knew this earlier.

for beatboxing, i learnt a grime routine this week -- created by artsy. i am genuinely enjoying this process of learning from someone who not only knows what they're doing, but can actually teach and coach properly. there's so much value in learning from someone who's walked the path before you. i learnt a lot from him.

## 📝 Reading Insights

i've finally finished reading **《段位》** -- and it is definitely a book i will come back to again and again.

looking back, i do wish i had made better notes while reading. i think deep books like this really deserve proper reflection and digestion. otherwise, the ideas risk slipping into what i call the *cold storage* of my brain -- still there, but hard to retrieve when i actually need them.

this also got me thinking more seriously about how i remember things. i have started experimenting with different ways to recall knowledge from my "second brain," instead of just consuming and moving on.

next up, i am starting **How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking**, recommended by Lio. feels like the right book at the right time.

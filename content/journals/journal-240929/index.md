## Reflections

this week, i went back to malaysia to celebrate 79th birthday (华人生日) of my grandpa (爷爷) 👴🏽. it was such a priceless moment seeing him so happy that night 🥺❤️. time really does fly—it feels like just yesterday he was still the strong, sharp grandpa, but now, he's aged. seeing him now, young at heart but older in body, is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. it reminds me **how fragile time is, how every moment we spend together is precious.** seeing my grandparents, my parents, my nieces, everyone age... it's hard to accept... and i don't want to face that reality, but, seeing how well they are all doing, seeing the love we share, somehow makes it easier. it's like a wave of bittersweet emotions all at once, it's complex.

i've been thinking a lot about time lately, how quickly it passes, and how i spent it. i want to be more present, to focus on what really matters—family, love, connection. i've started small, hiding most of my social media apps, and honestly, it's helping. it's a little step, but it feels like the right one. **i don't want to look back and realise i've missed out on the important things because i was too busy staring at a screen.** i want to really know my family, understand them better, and love them even more. ❤️

time, please don't fly so fast... 🥺🥲😭 let me soak in these moments just a little longer.



## 📝 Reading Insights from **The Diary of a CEO**:

1. **Be a Plan-A thinker**: while i don't entirely agree with this mindset, it does make sense in some situations. being a Plan-A thinker forces you to focus on your goal with no distractions—there's no backup plan to fall back on. like the book says, "Having a backup plan, or even considering one, has been shown to potentially hinder your performance by making you less driven to hit your primary goal." without plan B, u have no choice but to work harder.
2. **Perseverance & consistency**: **"Pain in every walk of life is unavoidable, but the pain that we create by trying to avoid pain is avoidable."** this really resonated with me. it's a reminder that trying to avoid discomfort or pain often creates more problems than facing it head-on.
3. **Pressure is a Privilege**: stress and pressure aren't the same thing. while pressure can lead to stress, it can also be a driving force for growth when handled well. **"Comfortable and Easy are short-term friends but long-term enemies. If you're looking for growth, choose the challenge."** choosing challenges over comfort is what leads to real growth.

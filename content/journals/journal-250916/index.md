## ✨ Highlights of the Week

had a realisation this week from talking to one of the guy from zuhlke (my interviewer), wow, it was really a wake up call for me. the highlight of the week, even of this quarter.

i've been calling myself something who builds things from scratch, but did i really? i might've just been really good at adapting to new technologies and tools, utilising them, but did i really build something from scratch?

the discussion was so insightful, he was so transparent about the view he had on me upon asking some deep questions regarding about my previous work and tools.

i was the kid that didn't read any instruction but still could build the whole logo puzzle up, that was what i love to do, i love to break the rules to build things since a kid. which i didn't always tend to understand why it work, or the core concept of stuff...

and from this conversation i had, i started to think. started to realise...

damn.

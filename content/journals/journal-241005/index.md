## A Fulfilling Week

on the 2nd of october, my siblings and i jumped on a call with my mom, right at midnight sg time, to wish her a happy birthday! it was special because this year, we were all in different countries, but we still made the time to connect, no matter the distance. we promised to celebrate properly with dinner when my sis gets back on saturday, can't wait! ❤️

toby invited me for a 3-day free trial session at Fitness First. he mentioned our gym sessions were even more valuable than his private ones 🥺.

AND daidai whipped up 刀削面 for me at his place, it was so good-who knew instant noodles could taste that scrumptious!? have you ever had instant noodles so good you wouldn't believe they came from a packet?! that's what he cooked up for me! the view from his condo and the comfort of those noodles-it was all just what i needed. OH, and let me not forget—he has the cutest cat! 😭

unfortunately, our plan to celebrate my mom's birthday got delayed because of my sis' flight being rescheduled 😔. but i am really looking forward to when she is back and we can have that family moment together.



## 📝 Reading Insights: Negative Manifestation

1. **"Failure tempts people to lose focus as motivation and belief decrease, but success tempts people to lose focus even more, as opportunities, offers, and capabilities increase."** this made me think—sometimes, when things are going well, it's easier to get distracted by new offers and ideas, and you lose sight of the core goal.
   1. **Failure and Loss of Focus**: when people experience failure, their motivation and self-belief often diminish. this leads to a loss of focus because their confidence in achieving their goals has been shaken. in other words, **failure makes it harder to stay on track due to the discouragement it creates.**
   2. **Success and Loss of Focus**: the surprising insight here is that success can be an even bigger challenge to focus. When people experience success, it can open up many new opportunities, offers, and capabilities. while this sounds like a positive situation, it can also lead to a dilution of focus. success brings distractions in the form of new projects, side ventures, or alternative paths. **the challenge here is to maintain the same level of discipline and singular focus** that helped achieve success in the first place.

> while failure demotivates, success overwhelms with possibilities, both of which can cause a loss of focus. the key takeaway is the **importance of staying focused** no matter the external circumstances—whether in the face of failure or success.

2. **"You can predict someone's success in any area of their life by observing how willing and capable they are at dealing with uncomfortable conversations. Your personal progression is trapped behind an uncomfortable conversation."** it's a reminder for me that the path to growth often comes through discomfort, especially when it comes to communication.

3. **"Embracing this duality of thought – balancing positivity with negativity – equips us with the wisdom, fortitude and foresight to forge a more successful path forward."**

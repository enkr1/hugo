## ✨ Highlights of the Week

- **Personal update**: this week was a busy week for me to migrate to my new place. renting a room in singapore is tough. i feel like a hermit crab... i skipped quite a few gym sessions because i had to clean up and unpack stuff. from the lease that we just ended, my sister and i did not get the full deposit back, which was totally ridiculous. we were speechless but just let it go. (might update more on this next time?)
- **Beatboxing**: oh dear, i had a bad flu this week :( didn't beat as much, but i've been progressing on my throat bass and vibration throat bass. i'm getting more and more comfortable with it!
- **Work**: i had my first ByteDance All-Hands in person! it was totally an eye-opening experience to hear the heads of each department talk about the updates of last quarter, their visions for the departments, products, and company.



## Little Lesson

this week i re-learnt that to have a solid and great product, you need to be the user. you need to be in the user's shoes to actually see how good or bad your product is. by doing this, you can get first-hand feedback and better understand your product and the overall experience, said Rubo Liang. i totally agree with this point. i learnt this key concept from Lio when i was working at Pixium Digital. he was my leader and the CTO of the company. i used to build something inhuman when i was in charge of my first few projects, even though i had a UX/UI background. that's strange, isn't it? and yes, i still made those mistakes. but after listening to him, i tried to use my product and realised, wow, he was totally right. this is a solid point and something to always remember as a developer, project manager, or leader.

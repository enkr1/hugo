## ✨ Highlights of the Week
- **Family Time:** my brother came back from Spain this week, and it was both great and challenging to reconnect. he's evolved in many ways—he's grown, learnt, and become a better version of himself. however, we also noticed a bit of arrogance and ego creeping in, which made our interactions a bit tense. we wanted to help him see some of these changes, but our approach came off more like an attack than a helpful conversation. It reminded me that even with good intentions, the way you frame your words really matters.

- **Communication Insight:** this week, i really learnt the importance of how you frame what you say. It's not just about having good intentions or the right message—it's about delivering that message in a way that others can easily digest and understand. if you frame things poorly, you might convey the wrong meaning, leading to confusion or even conflict. This idea resonated with me deeply, especially in the context of my work where communication and structuring information are crucial, just like how a well-structured JSON makes life easier for the backend developers.



## Little Lesson
this week i was reminded that communication isn't just about what you say but how you say it. when you frame your thoughts well, you make it easier for others to understand and engage with your ideas. this is true in personal conversations, like the ones i had with my brother, and it's also true in professional settings. just as a well-structured data object streamlines coding; clear and thoughtful communication smooths the path in life. it's not about giving vague, surface-level information, but about sharing your thoughts in a way that makes sense and is easy to digest for others.

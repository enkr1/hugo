## ✨ Highlights of the Week
- **Work:** full productivity at work, got a lot of todos done! felt really productive and even managed to get off work earlier. doing so much better compared to my last quarter where i'd be OT-ing till 4 am.
- **Gym:** back to my usual gym routine (PPL), only resting a day now! getting back into my old routine feels so good!
- **Personal Priorities:** finally got some time for personal priorities and even squeezed in some learning!



## Little Lesson
i relearned how important it is to make notes and write down your todos. it's like having a second brain, which reminded me of the book "Building a Second Brain" by Tiago Forte. this book really changed my life. it was recommended by my previous leader, Lio!

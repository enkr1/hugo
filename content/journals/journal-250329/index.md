## ✨ Highlights of the Week

heehee writing this journal on my way back to jb, and my mac only has 7% battery left 🥰

after a full reset, i feel brand new again. i took almost three weeks to really recover, reflect, and rebuild. but damn, i'm so proud of  myself for allowing that space to slow down and go deep. 🥺

honestly, i'm glad this happened. it was the push i needed to step out of my comfort zone and get back on the route that aligns with who i truly want to become. deep down, i've always known i'm going to be successful—but how could i ever get there without going through these downs?

all part of the plan.

i just need to react calmly, move with intention, and make the right decisions at each crossroad. even though i was a little shaken, i know these small losses are just bricks—building the foundation for a stronger, wiser me.

and omg, side note—you won't believe what happened on tuesday morning. i was heading to the office like usual, probably still half-dreaming... and somehow, i accidentally flung my iPad into the air while walking to the mrt station 💀💀💀 i never use cases for my gadgets cuz i love the raw feel of them, but man, when it flew and hit the ground, my heart went like, "ouUchhhhhhh..." 🥹

on the 30th, i finally made it back to jb for 扫墓 after ages omg! even tho it was so tiring, but honestly, it was such a good time. time with family, laughter, prayers, food—all of it just reminded me how thankful i am for 节日 like this as a chinese malaysian. it's something you can't quite explain, but it just feels right. ❤️



## 📝 Reading Insights

recently, i haven't been reading books on my ipad during my morning commute anymore. i kinda shifted that habit—these days, i find myself talking to gpt instead. about anything. personal stuff, random thoughts, deep questions, even things i'm just suddenly curious about. i guess i've always been that curious kid who loves thinking, wondering, questioning.

honestly, tools like gpt have helped me a lot these past few years. it's like having a thinking partner that's always down to explore whatever's on my mind. and sometimes, that's exactly what i need to start my day right. ☀️🧠

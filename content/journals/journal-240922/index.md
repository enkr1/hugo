## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this past week felt pretty normal, but not in a bad way. it was mid-autumn festival, and i had a quick gathering with my relatives. the weather, though, wasn't having it—it rained so heavily, felt like i could see things flying around! despite that, it was a good time with the family.



## Little Lesson

one little lesson that i relearned this week is how **"If you don't care about tiny details you'll produce bad work because good work is the culmination of hundreds of tiny details. The world's most successful people sweat the small stuff"**. this really hit home for me, especially when i think about beatboxing—something i know well. i've realised that the key to becoming great in any area, especially in beatboxing, is focusing on the smallest details. the moments when i step back and refine those tiny things are what push my skills to the next level.

## ✨ Highlights of the Week
- **Elixir Exploration:** this week, i dived back into some elixir topics and even tried deploying my app on fly.io. i'm really seeing the potential in elixir and its famous phoenix framework. i'm excited to start a side project with it and relearn everything i know about elixir!
- **Reading:** i've been reading *The Diary of a CEO* by Steven Bartlett. one quote that really resonated with me is: "Do the thing you fear, and keep on doing it. that is the quickest and surest way ever yet discovered to conquer fear." it's been on my mind all week and has inspired me to push through my own fears.



## Little Lesson
this week reminded me of the importance of revisiting foundational knowledge. whether it's with elixir or in life, going back to the basics can open up new perspectives and reignite your passion. continuous learning and embracing the journey are key to growth.

## my last journal of 2024 🫶🏻

hello, dear reader!

it's been a while since my last journal, and now, here we are—days away from 2025. this marks my final journal entry for 2024, and there's so much i want to share!

december has been an intense month. so much has happened that i'm not even sure where to start. but let's take it one story at a time.

on the 6th of december, friday, i received some shocking announcements at work (the details are confidential, so i can't share much here). at that moment, i was completely thrown off—stunned and unsure how to react. you know those moments when life blindsides you? this was one of them. i didn't know how to process it, but i told myself, "what's done is done. all you can do now is focus on how you respond." so that's what i tried to do.

on the bright side, one part of the announcement i can share is that i got the opportunity to go on a solo business trip for a project i was responsible for! honestly, it was nerve-wracking—my first time traveling alone for work, handling everything by myself. i was unprepared, worried, and unsure. but looking back, i think i did okay. the trip taught me a lot, and after reflecting on it, i know there's still so much room for growth.

that friday was a blur. after the announcement, i had no time to process anything before rushing off to grab a quick lunch between meetings. it was a whirlwind of emotions—shock, confusion, gratitude, and everything in between. but amidst the chaos, my amazing team gave me a sweet moment to pause. they surprised me with a cake and coffee for my birthday! 🥺 they're honestly the best, and i felt so touched that they remembered despite how busy everything was. it was a reminder of how lucky i am to work with such thoughtful people. 😭

of course, there was no time to rest. meetings filled up the rest of the day. but shoutout to my colleague, **junjie**, who helped me sort out logistics like drafting my business travel letter. he made my life so much easier, and i'm super grateful for his kindness.

now, about the trip—Beijing was incredible! i finally got to visit ByteDance's headquarters at 大钟侍 and another office at 融中心. the 16-day business trip was a whirlwind of productivity and new experiences. my primary objective was to oversee the UAT process and ensure a successful project delivery. while the workload was intense, meeting colleagues and stakeholders in person brought a refreshing human connection that had been missing during months of remote collaboration. being on-site allowed me to dive deeper into project challenges, brainstorm solutions face-to-face, and even build stronger rapport with the team. honestly, it was more than just a work trip—it felt like an opportunity to grow both professionally and personally.

**curious about what my ByteDance life looks like, especially during my time in the Beijing offices?**

i've captured some highlights and behind-the-scenes moments from my journey in a special Instagram highlight titled **ByteDance 2** & **ByteDance 2.1**. feel free to check it out [here](https://www.instagram.com/enkr1/)—you might just catch a glimpse of my day-to-day adventures, the breathtaking office views, and the vibrant city life! 😊

the weekends in Beijing were magical. i went on solo adventures, ticking off places i'd always wanted to visit. walking through the historical 胡同s, soaking in the vibe of the city—it felt like stepping into a movie. 🥺

one of my first stops was 天坛公园. i was in awe of the ancient chinese architecture—it's just so majestic and grand. every detail of the buildings felt like a glimpse into the past, and i couldn't help but admire how much history they carry.

then, there was the 故宫—absolutely speechless. i mean, this was once the emperor's home... the sheer size of it left me in disbelief. i found myself wandering through the halls, just imagining what life must have been like back then.

another highlight was finally trying 四季民福. i've seen it all over 小红书, and i can confirm—it totally lives up to the hype. the food was amazing, and it was such a treat to tick it off my list.

i also spent some time at 颐和园 and 圆明园, two parks that couldn't be more different but both so special in their own way. 颐和园 was so peaceful and relaxing, a perfect place to just slow down and take a breath. meanwhile, the ruins at 圆明园 felt like a quiet reminder of history, bittersweet yet humbling to see in person.

南锣鼓巷 was another favourite. i caught the sunset here, and let me tell you, it was breathtaking. Beijing's winter sunsets hit differently—so early, around 4pm, but the glow it left in the sky was unforgettable. 🌅

and, of course, i couldn't miss 什刹海, strolling by the lakes, surrounded by locals and tourists alike. it had such a vibrant energy, yet it felt calming at the same time.

these moments brought me so much joy. every place i visited left an impression, and i know i'll carry these memories with me forever. Beijing really has a charm that's hard to put into words—it's a mix of history, culture, and just pure magic. 🥺🫶🏻

but as december went on, it wasn't all smooth sailing. just a week after the initial announcement, my leader shared that the decision had been cancelled. i hadn't even fully processed the first news when the second hit. it was an emotional rollercoaster—relief, confusion, and gratitude all at once. but i reminded myself: **What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.** life is unpredictable, and sometimes all you can do is adapt and move forward.

as the year-end approached, i took some much-needed leaves. i originally planned a trip to phuket in mid-december, but with the business travel and the critical project release, i had to cancel it. instead, i used the time to rest, recharge, and reflect. honestly, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise—having that "me time" was exactly what i needed.

before closing the year, my crew, Obelisk, and i worked on a countdown beatbox performance for the new year's eve celebration. it was such a fun project, and i'm so excited to see how it turns out on the 31st! 🎉

thank you for being part of my journey this year. ❤️

this isn't a full reflection of 2024—i'll save that for my next blog. but for now, here's to closing the year on a hopeful note.

bring it on, 2025! 🎯

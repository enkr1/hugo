## ✨ Highlights of the Week

i went on a trip to China for the first time! omg, i don't know where to start... it was amazing. honestly, i don't think i can put in into words, ok, so i'll let the pictures do the talking this time. pictures speak a thousand words, right? 🥹

> i will just attach some of my favourite pictures later~

on a less cheerful note, i came back with a really really bad sore throat back that i completely lost my voice halfway through the day at work. 😭 thank god for the clinic right next to our office that's covered by insurance-it was so convenient. i literally just gave em my name, talked to the doc, grabbed my meds and left.

the doc gave me 2 days of mc, but i still went to work the next day. idk, maybe i was just feeling guilty about taking a day off, but honestly, my body was sreaming at me to rest. so the day after, i finally listened. ended up sleeping for 11 hours straight... and omg, that was the rest i needed! felt so much better afterwards! FULL RECHARGED! 🔋

but my voice still... and my beatbox competition is approaching 😭



## 📝 Reading Insights

AND i finally started reading **Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear**! it's been on my reading list for ages, and i am so excited to dive into it. just flipping through the first few pages has already given me a glimpse of how impactful this book could be for making lasting changes. i can't wait to apply these principles to my daily life!

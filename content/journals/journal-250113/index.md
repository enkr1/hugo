## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this week i made a conscious effort to be more productive at work-not just to compensate for the time spent on my beijing trip, but also to challenge myself. i wanted to prove that with the right mindset, i could push my limits and achieve so much more. it's all about mental resilience. at work, i've been handling a requirement with manageable complexity, but it demands a critical focus on detail. as part of my goal this year, i'm striving to do things **well**, not just get them done. it's about adopting the mindset of [Done vs Done Well](/goals-2025#:~:text=Done%20vs%20Done%20Well), and this task is no exception. i've been taking my time, ensuring that the quality of my work aligns with that principle. it's been challenging, but i'm enjoying the process of learning and growing in this area. 🎯

as for the weekend, it was nothing short of amazing! i had the chance to gather with my relatives for an earlier Lo Hey (捞鱼生) @ [TungLok Peking Duck Novena](https://g.co/kgs/egQyvhv)! it felt so good to reconnect with them after such a long time, and it was a great way to kick off the lunar new year celebrations! 🧧 on top of that, it happened to be my aunty's birthday (肥肥妈妈). i surprised her with a cake, and the restaraunt went extra mile-they presented the cake on a large plate with dry ice underneath, creating an amazing fog effect. to top it off, they played some chinese EDM birthday songs, adding to the festive vibe HAHA! loved it so much, it was such a fun and heartwarming moment. big up to 同乐 for making the celebration so special!



## 📝 Reading Insights

as i have been kind of like relearning from the book of [Never Split the Differences by Chris Voss](/never-split-the-difference-by-chris-voss/), i have been trying to revise and apply some of the negotiation tactics in my daily life. it's been quite interesting to see how these strategies can be used in various situations, not just in business or high-stakes scenarios. i'm still working on mastering the art of tactical empathy and calibrated "no," but i'm excited to see how these skills evolve over time. 📚

i have been utilising these methods in my conversations with colleagues and friends, and it's been fascinating to observe the subtle shifts in dynamics and outcomes. i'm also trying to be more mindful of my body language and tone of voice, as these non-verbal cues play a significant role in communication. it's a work in progress, but i'm enjoying the process of learning and growing in this area. 💬

SO! i was randomly cleaning up my Spotify's playlist and saw that i have been following The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett podcast! which i planned to listen but always forgot to... so i clicked on it and saw a topic just caught my eye! [Body Language Expert: Stop Using This, It’s Making People Dislike You, So Are These Subtle Mistakes!](https://youtu.be/VHUrdELKjDw?si=6QJh_KsPTkIMvgxP) and i was like, "ok, that sounds interesting!" so i clicked on it and started listening to it. it was quite an insightful episode, and i learned a lot about the importance of body language in communication, she called it the language of cues. i've always been fascinated by the power of non-verbal cues, and this podcast episode reinforced the idea that our body language can speak volumes about our thoughts and emotions. it's a reminder to be more aware of how i present myself in different situations and how i can use body language to enhance my communication skills at work and in my personal life!

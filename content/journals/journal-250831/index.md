## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this week, i had an interview with one of my dream companies. honestly, it didn't go the way i expected, and i can't help but feel a bit disappointed in myself. i realised i had prepared slightly off balance — i over-prepared for the really tough, niche questions that i thought might trip me up, rehearsed endlessly for those... but in doing so, i overlooked some of the more fundamental basics. and when those came up, i stumbled. 😔

still, if i reframe it: the biggest win this week was definitely getting the opportunity in the first place (shoutout to the referral from my friend's friend 🙏🏽). but the biggest loss was me both underestimating and overestimating the wrong parts of the interview. i thought i'd do better than i did, and that gap between expectation and reality hurts the most. 🥺

that said, it's not all doom and gloom. i also had 7 other interviews this week that went relatively well. so maybe this is just one stumble in the bigger picture. i'll probably beat myself up over it for a while - but i also know this is one of those mistakes i'll carry forward and learn from. ❤️‍🩹

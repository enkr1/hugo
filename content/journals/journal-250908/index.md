## ✨ Highlights of the Week

- caught up again with my ex-colleague, hongjun. he shared something that really woke me up: "thinking and planning are always easy, but the hardest part is execution." simple, but so true.
- didn't manage to complete my tutorial before class... and honestly, it felt exactly like attending a work meeting without reading up on the discussion topics beforehand. lesson learned.
- spent such an awesome weekend with my friend. we went pulau ubin, trained legs together, then went back to school to study. balance of fun + grind. 🥹



another big highlight was interviewing with one of my favourite companies on my list. it was a completely new experience for me. i arrived an hour early, grabbed a coffee, and sat down to settle my nerves. about 30 mins later, one of the interviewers walked over, casually chatted with me for a bit, and then brought me into a private room with a thinkpad all set up with ubuntu. 🫣

as a mac user... let's just say 80% of my time was me yelling at the keyboard and 20% fixing my typos. 💀 but honestly... it was quite fun 11/10 experience.

the little win from this interview was that i managed to clearly explain what i could've done better, how i would've improved the solution with more time, and even outline the risks + best practices i'd apply. the loss? probably that i didn't practise enough on building things from 0 to 1, so i was a bit overwhelmed at first. but once i got into it, i found my rhythm. overall, fun, humbling, and motivating. ngl. 🚀

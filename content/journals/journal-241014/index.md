## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this week, something really struck me during one of my workout sessions with toby. i had been casually "coaching" him, showing him my workout style and sharing techniques i've picked up over the years. but what came next hit me like a life metaphor that i didn't see coming.



**"Work is like working out"**, toby said.

you can start off pushing hard—whether it's at work or in the gym. sometimes, you overdo it, like putting in long hours at work without the right strategy, or hitting the gym with bad form. the funny thing is, if no one points out that you're doing it wrong, you might not even realise it. that's where a personal trainer (PT) in the gym—or a mentor at work—comes in. they're there to guide you, correct your form, and show you the correct way, the better way, refine your technique, and show you a more effective path—one that not only helps you reach your goals but also gets you there faster and with greater precision. but here's the key difference: in work, people aren't going to proactively correct you, you have to be **proactive** yourself. ask the right questions, observe, listen, learn, and most importantly, **be consistent**. success comes down to consistently showing up and putting in the work, whether it's in the gym or in life.

**ByteDance and the Gym**

toby pointed out something else that really hit home for me. he said working at ByteDance is a lot like working out. there's a "7-2-1" approach there, where you dive into the deep end (the "7") without first mastering the basics (the "1"). it reminded me of when i first started gymming two years ago. i was clueless about proper form or technique, yet i still managed to get into shape by watching a few YouTube tutorials. but looking back, i wonder—**was all the time i spent really worth it?** would i have gotten there faster if i had invested in a PT early on? work is the same. you can't expect people to hold your hand. you have to seek out mentors, guidance, and constantly refine your "form." 💪

**Life Lessons from the Gym**

then toby dropped a truth bomb: *"you've succeeded in the gym, going from a skinny guy to a 'buff load,' so why not apply the same concept to life?"* 💡

that hit me hard. the way i push myself to the failure in the gym, the way i visualise each exercise to make sure it works—those same principles can be applied to life. and toby made me realise that i've actually been influencing others, showing them how to push themselves beyond their limits. now, it's my turn to find someone who can **influence me** and take me to the next level, just like i helped toby.

we also talked about how important it is to be specific in communication. vague feedback like "this is good" or "i think it's working" won't help anyone grow. you need to explain *why* something is good, and avoid phrases like "i feel like..." that leave things too open-ended. clarity and precision are what help people improve.

**Meeting Niq, the PT**

later in the week, we met niq, a PT at Fitness First, and he was just different. there was no ego, no attitude—just genuine passion for working out. he was sharing machines with us and offering small tips, like we were all gym buddies. at first, i didn't even know he was a PT. but when he dropped a tip on how to engage our triceps better during pushdowns, it clicked for me. it was one of those moments where you think you know something, but you're not applying it properly. it made me realise how important these small adjustments are. 💪

what really set niq apart from other PTs i've met was how freely and passionately he shared his knowledge, expecting nothing in return. it reminded me of how i approach things—i genuinely love helping people, without expecting anything back. seeing that same energy in niq made me realise that's the vibe i want to continue spreading in my life too.

**Reflections**

this week really opened my eyes to how the lessons we learn in one area—whether it's the gym, work, or relationships—can apply to others. consistency, communication, and the willingness to learn are the keys to success, no matter what you're striving for. just like in the gym, in life, you need the right form, the right guidance, and the right mindset to reach your goals.

**life and work are like a gym session—it's all about finding the right balance, asking the right questions, and putting in the effort every day, even when it's tough.** 🧠

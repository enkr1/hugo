## ✨ Highlights of the Week

thursday, i brought my new friend to lau pa sat, checked out the merlion, and walked around the city, had a few more gym sessions with her too. 🌃

AND... i received an interview invitation from my dream company 😭🙏🏽❤️ i am SOOOOOOOO excited just thinking about it! ADSLKJLKJDSALJKASD

5A1 4/5 重聚! though sadly ryan couldn't make it this time. 🥺

my prof for TCX1101, jonathon j dropped a quote in math class that really stuck with me.

> *"If you're not being pushed, being uncomfortable, you're not learning." - **Jonathon Teo, 20 Aug 2025***

one thing i felt i lost this week was not fully using the time after class to consult with professors. i could've done more homework beforehand to prepare better questions. instead, i found myself defaulting to asking gpt... which honestly feels a bit messed up, like i'm missing out on learning directly from experts right in front of me.

i also reflected a lot on how different things are in class versus at work. in class, people tend to rush for answers, but at work, it doesn't work like that. you can't just be the "smart, reactive student" who's quick on the spot - what matters more is patience, deeper thinking, and delivering something that actually holds up.

another big reflection (and tough decision) was to really focus on the **signal-to-noise ratio** in my life. i had to cut out things that aren't important and reprioritise my lists — my tasks, my time, everything.

also, missing my 121-day leetcode streak was rough... but i realised there are things more important right now that deserve my focus. letting go wasn't easy, but it's a big lesson for me. it doesn't mean i'm stopping the things i love - just shifting them down the priority list for now. sometimes, that's what growth looks like. 🌱

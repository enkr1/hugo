## ✨ Highlights of the Week

i had a lot of conversations with different people this week, and i found myself both pouring out and receiving a lot of energy and inspiration. ✨

the most memorable one was a deep talk with my sister about *what i'm good at* and *what i love doing*. these two questions have been on my mind lately, especially after watching a reel on ig (i can't even remember who said it), but there was this one line that completely woke me up:

**"the world needs what you are good at. when you contribute what you're naturally good at, the world will find a way to reward you."**

that really hit me.

i brought this up with my sister because i know she's great at analysing emotions and understanding people. it's something she does effortlessly, and i think that's one of her biggest strengths. so i figured—if anyone could help me unpack this, it would be her.

she pointed out something that i never really considered before: *what i'm good at is something i always assumed everyone could do*. i never thought of it as a strength, because to me, it felt normal. but in reality, not everyone sees things the way i do. she made me realise that i have strong **visual-spatial skills, pattern recognition, and the ability to learn quickly by observing and doing**.

it was such an *woah, wait... right...* moment for me.

and now, i want to spend more time figuring out not just *what i'm great at doing*, but also *what i truly love doing*. and honestly? i didn't expect it to be this hard. i guess i don't know myself as well as i thought... 🥺

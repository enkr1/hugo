## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this weeks highlight would be me finally taking the first baby steps toward my personal trainer "project". after resetting my goal list and reprioritising my current projects, i decided to move PT higher up—even though my studies still take the top spot, i want to actively create small experiments to test myself.

so, i started simple: making more fitness friends i could "teach" and get feedback from. i posted on xhs about my intuition around training and invited people to work out together at AF/NUS gyms. to my surprise, three people joined me last week! it was so much fun, and i really got to see where i'm strong and where i'm still weak when it comes to teaching.

one thing i noticed: i can break down exercises in simple terms for guys quite naturally, but i struggle more with explaining to females—probably because of differences in height, leverage, and strength, which change how they perceive movement cues. that's something i'll need to take note on and improve on.

besides that, i've also been keeping up with job applications, making sure i aim for the right roles. and of course, i've been starting lessons early at NUS to stay ahead—small wins stacking up!

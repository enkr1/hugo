## ✨ Highlights of the Week

the other big highlight this week was me recompleting my leetcode 75 challenge—but this time, with a different mindset. instead of just grinding through and memorising solutions, i set a new goal: to recognise the underlying patterns behind each problem. this shift from memorisation to understanding felt like such a game-changer.

and here's the best part—i didn't just keep it to myself. i took the opportunity to teach my sister some of the problems after solving them, hAHAHA even tho she didn't really wanna know HAHAHA. and yes, wow, that process really cemented the concepts in my mind. teaching forces you to break things down simply, and in doing so, you end up learning it even better yourself. i honestly believe this is one of the best ways to lock knowledge into your brain for good.

every time i go through this learning process, i can't help but feel so grateful to be alive in this AI era. learning has never been easier. there's honestly **no excuse not to know something nowadays**—you can just GPT it up. whether it's ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, or even 豆包 (shoutout to bytedance—my go-to for chinese queries!), there are just so many tools right at our fingertips.

i feel so lucky to be able to do this. lucky to be alive, lucky to still be learning. 🥺

humans are amazing. and so is AI. 🚀

makes me wonder—how much more can i learn if i just stay curious every day ✨

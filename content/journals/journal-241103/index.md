## ✨ Highlights of the Week

this week, i felt super productive at work, managing to wrap up most of my tasks right on time or even ahead of schedule.

each day had a familiar rhythm—get up, commute with a good book, work, hit the gym, beatbox practice, unwind with some me-time, then sleep. it may have been routine, but there's a sense of calm in the consistency.

i also decided to head back to malaysia to spend time with my family. my mum recently hurt her lower back, and i could feel the urge to be close, to share some quality time and be there for her. this time with family, no matter how brief, always feels grounding. ❤️

another bright spot was reconnecting with my friends from secondary school. these are people who have been part of my journey for years, and catching up with them brought back so many good memories. seeing them doing so well made me genuinely happy, and i'm just grateful to have these friendships still going strong.

普普通通 平平淡淡的一周

但是又觉得很充实 💪🏼



## 📝 Reading Insights
### THE LAW: LEVERAGE THE POWER OF PROGRESS

To solve problems, encourage and celebrate small wins. This provides continuous forward momentum, which creates an atmosphere of success and a positive sense that a team is moving towards their bigger goals. Employees are most motivated when they are engaged with the work that they're doing, and feel like they are making a difference.

> “The most professionally rewarding feeling in the world is a sense of forward motion.”

### THE LAW: YOU MUST BE AN INCONSISTENT LEADER

It is impossible to seamlessly blend into a team as a jigsaw piece unless you comprehend the unique shape of each of your team members. Sir Alex Ferguson's acumen in this regard was legendary, as attested to by his former players and staff, and even rival managers. He possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of everything from the hobbies of his players' wives to the names of their pets, and as Rio Ferdinand told me, even their grandfathers' preferred brand of whisky. More significantly, he knew that every member of his team was propelled by vastly different motivators. While one player may have thrived under Ferguson's infamous ‘hairdryer' treatment (where he would shout angrily at them in the dressing room or on the training ground), another may have required a more compassionate approach, and still another may have been motivated by a more hands-off approach. This is why Ferguson didn't have to be the tactical mastermind that many assume he must have been, but rather an emotional savant. When you're in the business of motivating people, **emotional management is everything.**

> Great leaders are fluid, flexible, and full of fluctuation. They are whatever shape they need to be, to complete your motivation.

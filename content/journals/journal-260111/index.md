## ✨ Highlights of the Week

it was a really productive week. i finally feel like i'm back on track.

i've finally... yes finaly started doing cardio after like 3 years of working out: incline walking (15 incline, 3–5 speed) and the stairmaster 💀

&#x20;and honestly, it felt brutal but good. the kind of tired that reminds you you're alive and moving again.

i've also been prepping for semester 2 (Y1S2), and i genuinely can't wait to start. there's something really exciting about knowing you're about to learn new things again, to be stretched in new ways.

it feels like the game has just been restarted. fresh map, fresh mindset. 

and for once, i'm actually excited about that!

## 📝 Reading Insights

i've been reading **《段位》** since last july - slowly, one chapter at a time, and damn, every chapter still hits.

recently, i was on **chapter 9: 入神 · 掌握人心，不战而屈人之兵**, and it made so many things click for me, especially when i look back at past workplace experiences.

suddenly, certain behaviours from seniors, leaders, and “长辈” that i once couldn't understand… started to make sense. what looked confusing or even unreasonable back then was often part of a longer, quieter, more deliberate setup.

it reminded me that not everything is meant to be loud, direct, or immediately visible. some moves only make sense *after* you've lived through enough to recognise the pattern.
